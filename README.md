## 🚀 Project Overview

This is my **first React project**, a clean and modern **Tech Job Openings Dashboard** built using **React.js, HTML, and CSS**.  
It showcases job listings from top tech companies like **Meta, Google, Apple, and Microsoft** — inspired by FAANG-style career pages.

Each job card displays:
- 🏢 Company logo and name  
- 💼 Job title and level  
- ⏰ Date posted  
- 💲 Pay rate (per hour)  
- 📍 Location  
- 🔘 “Apply Now” button
